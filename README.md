## Key Features

### Workout multi-step form/ A small form that allows the user to setup their timer
The form is displayed after selecting the setup-timer button. It is composed of three different section each with their own set of unique inputs and a pair of buttons at the bottom to assist with navigating between each form section. I decided to use a multi-step form in this design as I believed it would be a easy method to gather all the user required data at once to run the app other core features. 

### Workout progress information/ Included a very small feature that will indicate how many exercises the user has left
Just above the timer on the left-hand side is a some text 
### Resting visual cues/ Included coloured queues for rest and workouts.

### Evaluation 
Overall I am happy with the simplistic design of the app and its currently easy to use and understand features.
